            and fully deployed process management approach in delivering solutions to all our esteemed customers. We
            have a well defined end-to-end high level process map, with precise start and end points, inputs and outputs
            for each process. All processes are detailed and meticulously flowcharted down to the minutest detailed
            sub-process level, and documented within the ORACLE system. The ORACLE based project management system, is
            blended with our ongoing program of QMS process audits, to assess and refine the overall process
            definitions. This, to our credit, we believe is the first full-scale implementation of such a system in the
